TODO: 

- (DONE) Timeout on Quail "readline" to ensure that lost connection doesn't block closing the window
- (DONE) Add "start recording" button in record pane in addition to ability to do from menubar (becomes "stop" when recording)
	- Allow entry box to grow to fill extra space
- Fix full-screen so that the app opens full screen
- Fix launch window so that it isn't blocking
- (DONE) Add options to change COM PORT, attempt serial re-connection, in menubar Quail tab
- (DONE) Handle failed connection on start (data_process keeps trying until it has a connection)
- Add capacity to add red and blue lines to plot (doesn't actually trigger anything, just provides a reference point for 
	desired or max/min values)
	- Just plot a line from -plotwidth to zero at some scaled y-value, need to add to blitting list of updated objects
- Talk to Tim/Damian about adding status indicators for valves into serial output, create separate window that tracks 
	whether valves are open/closed, how many times squibs have been blown (have data channels and status channels)
- Be able to change unit labels and add a scale factor option
