TODO: 

- Don't open to actual full-screen, just to window that covers screen
- Fix resizing so that shrinking the screen down still displays something intelligible
- Fix launch window so that it isn't blocking
- Indicate that abort requires double-click somehow
- Fix formatting of aliases in dropdown
- Add line-plotting feature
- Adjust y-axis scaling to allow negative values (take minimum of data + [0])
- Add scrolling to ChannelPane, ensure that adjusting the value of num_data_channels in Quail allows for more data to be displayed
- Allow user to add scale factor (could be useful for scaling raw data)
- Finish adding header comments
- Add status indicator window after adjusting Quail serial output to show the status of the solenoids/squibs
