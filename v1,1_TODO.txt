TODO: 

- (DONE) Add ability to switch between "Ox" and "Fuel" panels
- Adjust time from quail to seconds (value over serial is in milliseconds I think)
- Don't open to actual full-screen, just to window that covers screen
- Fix resizing so that shrinking the screen down still displays something intelligible
- (DONE) Fix launch window so that it isn't blocking (overhaul the function altogether, probably, just change the text on the LAUNCH button)
- (DONE) Indicate that abort requires double-click somehow
- Fix formatting of aliases in dropdown on Windows
- Fix Windows bug where changing time width causes issues with title and axis limit over-drawing
- Add line-plotting feature
- Adjust y-axis scaling to allow negative values (take minimum of (data + [0]) )
- Add scrolling to ChannelPane, ensure that adjusting the value of num_data_channels in Quail allows for more data to be displayed
- Allow user to add scale factor (could be useful for scaling raw data, not much additional computation)
- Finish adding header comments everywhere!
- Add status indicator window after adjusting Quail serial output to show the status of the solenoids/squibs (read the pins on each loop to get status)
- Add battery voltage as one of the data items passed over serial
- Try running w real Quail!
